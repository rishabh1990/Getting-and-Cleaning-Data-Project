# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Description.

## Description
1.We get our raw data from this file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2.After downloading the file we unzip it and then set our working directory to the loaction where the unzipped file is saved.

3.Thereafter we will follow the steps described in the project details:
 We will create R script called run_analysis.R that a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set b) Extracts  only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the    activities in the data set d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names e)From the data set in step 4,  creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
4. Finally we will create the file tidy_data.txt using write.table() command.

5. The description of all the variables can be found in code_book.cmd
